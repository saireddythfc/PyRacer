# PyRacer

A simple racecar obstacle course built with Pygame and some love.

Be sure to include crash.wav (car crash sound effect) and jazz.wav (for some sweet background music).


### Creating .exe file
- Leveraging the cx_freeze module in Python
- Create setup.py and define the py file as executable and include relevant external files
- Run the command: python setup.py build (Mind you, takes a few minutes!)
- Enjoy old-school .exe file in the build folder!
